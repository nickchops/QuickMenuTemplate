This is a template project for a main menu to help you get started building a Quick game.
It includes how to set up and tear down scenes, using the VirtualResolution helper,

This will become part of a full but compact game called "Condensation!", intended to
demonstrating more useful functionality like physics and more complex touch events.

The fule game is being added as part of the game jam template files here:
